# fp-front

<p>This elm project is a front end to the back end found at https://github.com/fdinsen/FP-backend-java .</p>
<p>It is a system that adds books with authors to users, and then gets a list of all books on a given user. </p>


<br>
<p>The model is a Tuple that holds two sub-models, one for the "add book" module and one for the "get books" module. </p>
<p>The system uses Elm-Bootstrap-5.2.0 to format the view.</p>
<p>Both modules are visible at once and are updated independent of eachother.</p>
