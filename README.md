# fp-front

This elm project is a front end to the back end found at https://github.com/fdinsen/FP-backend-java .

It is a system that adds books with authors to users, and then gets a list of all books on a given user. 


The model is a Tuple that holds two sub-models, one for the "add book" module and one for the "get books" module. 

The system uses Elm-Bootstrap-5.2.0 to format the view.

Both modules are visible at once and are updated independent of eachother.
